Student Directory
=================

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of sutdents enrolled on the course at Makers Academy, sorted by cohort. 

It is written in plain Ruby and (unfortunately) not (yet) test driven. 
The plan is to update a series of tests for this soon. 

How to use 
----------

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
